# KInARow-Project
AI game-playing agent built in Python for a generalized K-in-a-Row game as part of UW's CSE 415 (Artificial Intelligence). My contributions included optimizing static evaluation, implementing Zobrist hashing for state reuse, and creating a dynamic dialogue system for the agentâ€™s in-game utterances.
